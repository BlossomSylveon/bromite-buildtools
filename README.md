# bromite-buildtools

this repo contains my build machine and some scripts I use for Bromite development.

the ci uses a modified version of the gihub runner (avaiable [here](https://github.com/uazo/runner)) and use [sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox) to improve security

it also contains everything you need to use a self-hosted modified version of [goma](https://github.com/uazo/goma-server) for a multi-machine build
